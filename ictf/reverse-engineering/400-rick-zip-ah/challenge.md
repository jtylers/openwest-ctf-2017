# Finland - Rick, Zip, Ah
```
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just want to tell you how I'm feeling
tta make you understand

Never nna give you up, never nna let you down
Never nna run around and desert you
Never nna make you cry, never nna say odbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're nna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never nna give you up, never nna let you down
Never nna run around and desert you
Never nna make you cry, never nna say odbye
Never nna tell a lie and hurt you

Never nna give you up, never nna let you down
Never nna run around and desert you
Never nna make you cry, never nna say goodbye
Never nna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

I just want to tell you how I'm feeling
tta make you understand

Never nna give you up, never gonna let you down
Never nna run around and desert you
Never nna make you cry, never nna say odbye
Never nna tell a lie and hurt you
